# Next we are gonna do classification, model fine tuning and evaluation 
* I prepare train and test sets using my model and i gonna train couple models 
* I start from SVC model and i reach very high accuracy
* And i plot my model's predictions on confusion matrix
* I also check classification report and reach average f1-score 0.92, which is very good

# Then i gonna check couple other models
* I put them into the model list and train on my train set 
* Then take predictions and check the score results
* And i see that also as good as SVM are models: LogisticRegression and LinearDiscriminant

# I want to reach the highest score as possible, so i gonna use cross_val_score technique
* So i supply Kflod model, set data splits to 5, then shuffle the data
* Next i supply my models to the cross_val_score, next X and Y variables and KFold model
* Finally i can take mean score from all scores 
* I see that 3 model reach high accuracy: LinearDiscriminant, LogisticRegression and SVC 
* Then i check confusion_matrix on my LinearDiscriminant model, when i check average f1-score its 0.94 which is pretty high
