# I gonna start from data preprocessing
* First i drop missing values 
* Then i convert dates into proper form and take max and min dates

# Now we can create column, which contain the difference between the last date and the other dates

# Next we are gonna do feature engineering
* First we create column Age, which is the difference from the last recorded date and Year of birth
* Then will be spent, which are all the products added
* Next we take care of Marital_Status column by simplifing it
* We change the status to Partner of Alone, not any fancy descriptions
* We also simplify column of kids by adding Kidhome and Teenhome, next change name of column to Children
* Then we change Living_With column into numericall form
* Alone will be 1 and with partner 2 and we add children column 
* And it create Family_Size column
* Next Is_Parent column, if the condition is satisfied it signed the results
* Then we simplify Education column, by signing only 3 options instead of many more
* We also change the names of products
* And we drop columns which are already out of date of unuseful

# Outliers removal
* Now i can see that there are some values in description that are out of the blue
* So i use graph to plot my data and see its distribution
* Thanks to the graph plot i can just drop these outliers by simple code
* I can see that the age outliers lie beyond 90, so i save age below 90
