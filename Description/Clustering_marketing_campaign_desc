# I gonna start from data preprocessing
* First i drop missing values 
* Then i convert dates into proper form and take max and min dates

# Now we can create column, which contain the difference between the last date and the other dates

# Next we are gonna do feature engineering
* First we create column Age, which is the difference from the last recorded date and Year of birth
* Then will be spent, which are all the products added
* Next we take care of Marital_Status column by simplifing it
