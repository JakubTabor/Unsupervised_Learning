# Now i come to the part of dimensionality reduction
* We are gonna use highly correlation between features to reduce the similar ones
* And pack them into lower dimensional data, but in the same time with minimal loss of informations

# We choose the number of components as 3, so i set num of columns to 3 and put everything into dataFrame
* Now my newly dataset have only 3 columns, when i look at the description everything looks very well

# Now i can plot my data in 3D projection, just supply my 3 columns
* As i can see there is one big cluster of a data 
* And i want to create couple of calusters from it basing on their similarity
