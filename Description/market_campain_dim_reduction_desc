# Now i come to the part of dimensionality reduction
* We are gonna use highly correlation between features to reduce the similar ones
* And pack them into lower dimensional data, but in the same time with minimal loss of informations

# We choose the number of components as 3, so i set num of columns to 3 and put everything into dataFrame
* Now my newly dataset have only 3 columns, when i look at the description everything looks very well

# Now i can plot my data in 3D projection, just supply my 3 columns
* As i can see there is one big cluster of a data 
* And i want to create couple of calusters from it basing on their similarity

# I gonna use elbow method to figure out optimal number of clusters
* I supply to my model 10 options for clusters
* And we achieve the optimal score at 4 clusters

# And now we can use agglomerative clustering technique to get 4 clusters
* Next we plot the distribution of our data on 3D plot
* We can see that our clusters are placed around their own centroids

# And we get to the part of evaluation, we are gonna study patterns with help of graph plots
