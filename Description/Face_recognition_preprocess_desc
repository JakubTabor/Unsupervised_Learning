# We are gonna work with face images dataset, reduce dimensionality and build a prediction model 

# I start from deriving informations of our dataset:
! [](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Unsupervised_Learning/blob/main/Images/Face_recognition_preprocessing/dataset_info.png)

# Next i can look at the images 
* I define properties of my images and flatten them
* Then i make for loop of id-s of images 
* I set index, then x and y brackets

# I gonna also look at 10 faces of couple subjects
* So i set number of columns and then define rows, then supply it to the plot function
* Then i can supply number of indexes to get 10 faces of each subject 

# Then i gonna do data preparation
* I start from reshaping the images, and now they are (400-num. of images) and (size of input 64*64, so 4096)
* Next i split my data into train and test sets
* I check if there is class balance and thats correct 

# Next i gonna use PCA for dimensionality reduction
* As on the graph below we can see how data is transformed from 2 to 1 component data
* I gonna check my data reduced to only 2 dimensions, so i supply 2 for num. of components and transform my current data
