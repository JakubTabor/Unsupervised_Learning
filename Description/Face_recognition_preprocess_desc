# We are gonna work with face images dataset, reduce dimensionality and build a prediction model 

# I start from deriving informations of our dataset:

# Next i can look at the images 
* I define properties of my images and flatten them
* Then i make for loop of id-s of images 
* I set index, then x and y brackets
