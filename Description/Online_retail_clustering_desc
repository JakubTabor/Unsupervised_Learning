# First i start from data preprocessing
* I check how many of my values are missing in percentage
* I can see that 0.27% of data lack in Description column and int CustomerID column 24.93%
* For simplicity i just drop them

# Next will be data preparation
* I start from creating 3 columns for 3 new variables, which will describe very well clients behaviour of buying
* First will be Amount, which is total amount of transactions
* This column create by taking quantity column and multiply by unitprice column
* Next i group it by customers id 
* Another column will be Frequency, which is number of transactions
* I create it by taking InvoiceNo column group by customers id and count it
* Then i can merge the 2 newly created columns, based on customers id

# Next i gonna create Recency column
* First i change column with dates into proper format
* Then i define tahe latest data, which is max date
* Next i create diff column, which is the difference between latest date and any other dates
* And i take the minimum value from all that differences
* We take from it only days and it become our Recency column
* Next we merge that all

# Then we can deal with outliers
* First we make outliers analysis by graph plots

# We are gonna use IQR tehniqie
* To remove these outliers we need to define 2 quantiles, which represent the lower and upper bound
* And we do this for our 3 columns: Amount, Recency and Frequency
