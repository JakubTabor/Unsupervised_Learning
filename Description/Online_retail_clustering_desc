# First i start from data preprocessing
* I check how many of my values are missing in percentage
* I can see that 0.27% of data lack in Description column and int CustomerID column 24.93%
* For simplicity i just drop them

# Next will be data preparation
* I start from creating 3 columns for 3 new variables, which will describe very well clients behaviour of buying
* First will be Amount, which is total amount of transactions
* This column create by taking quantity column and multiply by unitprice column
* Next i group it by customers id
