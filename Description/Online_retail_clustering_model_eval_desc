# In this section i gonna create create the clusters from our data then evaluate it and derive conclusions
* First we try the elbow method, so i supply some number of clusters 
* And next create for loop in range of these clusters
* Then supply KMeans model, and when we run it we see on graph that the curve first decay rapidly and then turn into stable form
* We want to catch it the place where the curve is still decaying rapidly and it seems that 3 is the optimum place

# Another method which help me check the num. of clusters will be silhouette  score
* One again we make for loop in range of clusters and call silhouette  score on every cluster
* And we choose cluster 3 which have (0.508)
* It means that the data points in this cluster are enough close to each other
